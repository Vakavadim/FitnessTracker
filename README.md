# FitnessTraker

FitnessTraker it's new iteration of my previous project FitnessApp. I have came into a few decisions regarding architecture, dependency management and using architectural patterns after completed ios middle dev's architectural course.

First of all I decided to leave from MVVM presentetion layer pattern in favor Clean Swift which will allow me, in case of further development of the project, go to Clean Swift.

Secondly, I see a lot of needs in code refactoring, separating the business logic from other and correcting violations of the SOLID principles. 

My big mistake was to depend on UI design that in addition was far from perfect.
